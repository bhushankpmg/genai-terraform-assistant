To create a Terraform variables configuration for an Azure Storage Account, you'll typically define variables that will be used to customize the properties of the storage account, such as its name, location, resource group, and other configurations.

Here's an example of a Terraform `variables.tf` file that defines relevant variables for an Azure Storage Account:

```hcl
# variables.tf

variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the resource group where the storage account will be created."
  type        = string
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The Azure region where the storage account will be located."
  type        = string
  default     = "East US"  # You can set your preferred default location
}

variable "storage_account_name" {
  description = "The name of the storage account. The name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lower-case letters only."
  type        = string
}

variable "account_tier" {
  description = "The performance tier of the storage account."
  type        = string
  default     = "Standard"  # Options: Standard, Premium
}

variable "account_replication" {
  description = "The replication type for the storage account."
  type        = string
  default     = "LRS"  # Options: LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, GEO-ZRS, etc.
}

variable "enable_https_traffic_only" {
  description = "Indicates whether HTTPS traffic is required for the storage account."
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}

variable "void_tiers" {
  description = "Specifies the access tier for Blob storage (hot, cool, or archive)."
  type        = string
  default     = "Hot"  # Options: Hot, Cool, Archive
}

variable "tags" {
  description = "A mapping of tags to assign to the storage account."
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {}
}
```

### Explanation of Each Variable:
1. **resource_group_name**: Name of the Azure resource group where you'll create the storage account.
2. **location**: The Azure region for the storage account, with a default option provided.
3. **storage_account_name**: Unique name for the storage account, which must follow Azure naming conventions.
4. **account_tier**: Defines the performance tier for the
