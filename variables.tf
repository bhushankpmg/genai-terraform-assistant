To create a Terraform variables configuration for an Azure Storage Account, you can define variables that allow for the customization of the storage account's properties. Below is an example of how you could set up a `variables.tf` file to include relevant settings for an Azure Storage Account.

### variables.tf

```hcl
variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the resource group in which to create the storage account"
  type        = string
}

variable "storage_account_name" {
  description = "The name of the storage account. Must be globally unique."
  type        = string
  constraint  = "must match this regex: ^[a-z0-9]{3,24}$" # Storage account naming conventions
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The Azure region where the storage account will be created"
  type        = string
  default     = "East US"
}

variable "sku" {
  description = "The SKU (performance tier) of the storage account"
  type        = string
  default     = "Standard_LRS"
}

variable "kind" {
  description = "The kind of storage account (e.g., BlobStorage, StorageV2)"
  type        = string
  default     = "StorageV2"
}

variable "enable_https_traffic_only" {
  description = "Enable HTTPS traffic only"
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}

variable "access_tier" {
  description = "Access tier for the storage account (Hot or Cool)"
  type        = string
  default     = "Hot"
}

variable "tags" {
  description = "A map of tags to assign to the storage account"
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {}
}
```

### Example Usage in a Terraform Configuration

After defining variables, you can use them in your main Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`) to create the Azure Storage Account as follows:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = var.location
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = var.storage_account_name
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier
