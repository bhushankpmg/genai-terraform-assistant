To create a Terraform variables configuration for an Azure Storage Account, you'll want to define some common variables that can be used to specify various properties of the storage account, such as the name, location, resource group, and account tier.

Here is an example of a `variables.tf` file that defines a set of variables for configuring an Azure Storage Account:

```hcl
# variables.tf

variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the resource group where the storage account will be created."
  type        = string
}

variable "storage_account_name" {
  description = "The name of the storage account. It must be globally unique."
  type        = string
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The Azure region where the storage account will be created."
  type        = string
  default     = "East US"  # You can specify a default region or leave it out
}

variable "account_tier" {
  description = "The performance tier of the storage account."
  type        = string
  default     = "Standard"  # Other options are 'Premium'
}

variable "account_replication_type" {
  description = "The type of replication for the storage account."
  type        = string
  default     = "LRS"  # Options include LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, etc.
}

variable "enable_https" {
  description = "Whether to enable HTTPS for the storage account."
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}
```

### Explanation of each variable:

- `resource_group_name`: The name of the Azure Resource Group where you want to deploy the storage account.
- `storage_account_name`: The name of the storage account. Azure requires that storage account names be unique across the globe, and they must be between 3 and 24 characters in length.
- `location`: The Azure region where the storage account will reside. A default is provided, but you can specify others based on your needs.
- `account_tier`: The performance tier for the storage account, which can be Standard or Premium.
- `account_replication_type`: Defines the replication strategy for the storage account, with options like Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) or Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS).
- `enable_https`: A boolean variable to control whether to enforce HTTPS for accessing the storage account.
