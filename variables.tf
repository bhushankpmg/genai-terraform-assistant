To create a Terraform variables configuration for an Azure Storage Account, you'll want to define several relevant variables such as the resource group name, storage account name, location, account type, and other settings. Below is an example of how you can structure your `variables.tf` file for an Azure Storage Account.

### Example: `variables.tf`

```hcl
variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the resource group in which to create the storage account."
  type        = string
}

variable "storage_account_name" {
  description = "The name of the storage account. The name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and can only include lowercase letters and numbers."
  type        = string
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The Azure region where the storage account will be created."
  type        = string
  default     = "East US" # You can change this to any supported Azure region
}

variable "account_tier" {
  description = "The tier for the storage account. Can be 'Standard' or 'Premium'."
  type        = string
  default     = "Standard"
}

variable "account_replication_type" {
  description = "The replication type of the storage account. Valid options: LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, GEO-ZRS, etc."
  type        = string
  default     = "LRS"
}

variable "enable_tls" {
  description = "Should TLS be enabled for the storage account? This is typically true."
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}

variable "allow_blob_public_access" {
  description = "Indicates whether public access is allowed for blob services. Set to false for security."
  type        = bool
  default     = false
}
```

### Example: `terraform.tfvars`

You can define your variable values in a `terraform.tfvars` file like this:

```hcl
resource_group_name       = "my-resource-group"
storage_account_name      = "mystorageaccount"
location                  = "East US"
account_tier              = "Standard"
account_replication_type  = "LRS"
enable_tls                = true
allow_blob_public_access   = false
```

### Usage in `main.tf`

With the variables defined, you can use them when creating the Azure Storage Account resource as follows:

```hcl
provider "azurerm"
