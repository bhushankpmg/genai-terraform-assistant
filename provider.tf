Certainly! To use Terraform with Azure, you'll need to configure the Azure provider in your Terraform configuration. Below is a basic example of how to set up the Azure provider using the latest best practices.

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have an Azure account.
2. Install Terraform on your local machine.
3. You may want to use Azure CLI to authenticate.

### Provider Configuration Example

Here's an example of a `main.tf` file that configures the Azure Provider:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}

  # Optional: If you are running Terraform in Azure Cloud Shell, you can skip the authentication part.
  # If you're running Terraform locally, set your Azure credentials through the environment or using a service principal.

  # Uncomment and configure the following block as needed for a service principal
  # client_id       = var.client_id       # Optional: Service principal client id
  # client_secret   = var.client_secret   # Optional: Service principal client secret
  # tenant_id       = var.tenant_id       # Optional: Directory (tenant) id
  # subscription_id = var.subscription_id  # Optional: Azure subscription id
}
```

### Authentication

1. **Using Azure CLI**: If you have Azure CLI installed and are logged in, the above provider configuration will automatically use the credentials stored from your CLI session.

   To log in to Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. **Using Service Principal**: Alternatively, you can create a service principal in Azure and use its credentials in the provider configuration as indicated in the commented block. To create a service principal, you can run:
   ```bash
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/{subscription-id}"
   ```
   Make sure to replace `{subscription-id}` with your actual Azure subscription ID.

### Variables

If you choose to use the service principal credentials, you can set them in a `variables.tf` file.

```hcl
variable "client_id" {}
variable "client_secret" {}
variable "tenant_id" {}
variable "subscription_id" {}
```

Then, you can provide values for these variables via a `terraform.tfvars` file or directly in the command line when you run Terraform.

### Running Terraform

Once you have configured the provider:

1. Initialize the directory:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. Plan your
