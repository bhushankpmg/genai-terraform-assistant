Certainly! Below is a simple Terraform configuration to create an Azure Storage Account named `myuniquestorageacct` in a resource group named `myresourcegroup` located in the `West Europe` region.

Make sure you have Terraform installed and set up with Azure authentication to run this configuration.

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "myresourcegroup"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "myuniquestorageacct" # Must be globally unique
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS" # Locally Redundant Storage
  
  # Optional settings
  is_hns_enabled           = false # Set to true to enable hierarchical namespace for Data Lake Storage
}

output "storage_account_name" {
  value = azurerm_storage_account.example.name
}
```

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Save the above configuration in a file named `main.tf`.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `main.tf` is saved.
3. Initialize Terraform with the command:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
4. Review the execution plan with:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
5. Apply the configuration with:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

### Note:
- The storage account name must be globally unique across all Azure storage accounts. If `myuniquestorageacct` is not available, you'll need to change the name to something else.
- Adjust the `account_replication_type` if you need a different replication strategy (e.g., `GRS`, `RA-GRS`, etc.).
- Verify your Azure credentials and permissions to create resources in the specified subscription.
