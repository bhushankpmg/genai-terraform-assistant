To create an Azure Storage Account using Terraform, you can use the following configuration:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "myresourcegroup"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "myuniquestorageacct" # Must be globally unique 
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS" # Locally Redundant Storage
}
```

### Instructions:
1. **Install Terraform**: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine.

2. **Configure Azure Provider**: Ensure that you have access to Azure and have set up authentication using the Azure CLI, Service Principal, or Managed Identity in your environment.

3. **Create a New Directory**: Create a new directory for your Terraform configuration files.

4. **Create a File**: Save the above configuration code in a file named `main.tf`.

5. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` in your terminal while in the directory containing `main.tf`. This command will download the necessary provider plugins.

6. **Plan Your Deployment**: Run `terraform plan` to see what resources will be created.

7. **Apply the Configuration**: Run `terraform apply` to create the resource group and storage account. You will be prompted to confirm the action.

### Notes:
- Make sure the name of the storage account is unique across Azure, as storage account names must be globally unique.
- Modify account_tier and account_replication_type as necessary for your requirements.
- You can add more configurations (like networking rules, blob containers, etc.) as needed.
