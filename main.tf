To create an Azure Storage Account using Terraform, you'll need to have a Terraform configuration file that defines the necessary resources. Below is an example of a Terraform configuration that creates a Storage Account named `myuniquestorageacct` in a resource group named `myresourcegroup` located in the `West Europe` region.

First, make sure you have the latest version of Terraform installed and that you have the Azure CLI set up and authenticated.

Here's a basic example of a Terraform configuration to accomplish your task:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "myresourcegroup"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "myuniquestorageacct"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"

  tags = {
    environment = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Provider Block**: Specifies the provider as `azurerm`, and enables the feature block.
- **Resource Group**: Defines a resource group called `myresourcegroup` located in `West Europe`.
- **Storage Account**:
  - **name**: Must be globally unique in Azure, so you can replace `myuniquestorageacct` with a different name if it's already taken.
  - **resource_group_name**: Indicates which resource group the storage account belongs to.
  - **location**: Specifies the location of the storage account (i.e., West Europe).
  - **account_tier**: You can choose between `Standard` and `Premium`.
  - **account_replication_type**: Defined as `LRS` (Locally Redundant Storage), but you can select other types like `GRS`, `RA-GRS`, `RAGRS` based on your needs.
  - **tags**: Optional tags to help categorize resources.

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Save the above configuration to a file, e.g., `main.tf`.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.tf` file via the terminal.
3. Initialize the Terraform workspace:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
4. Preview the changes that will be applied:
   ```bash
