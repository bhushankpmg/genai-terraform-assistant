Certainly! Below is an example of a Terraform configuration file that creates an Azure Storage Account with the name `myuniquestorageacct` in a resource group called `myresourcegroup`, located in `West Europe`.

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "myresourcegroup"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "myuniquestorageacct"  # Storage account must be globally unique
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"  # Locally redundant storage

  # Optional: Specify additional settings based on your requirements
  enable_https_traffic_only = true
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "Dev"
    Project     = "MyProject"
  }
}
```

### Instructions to Use the Configuration

1. **Installation**: 
   Make sure you have Terraform installed. You can download it from the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

2. **Authentication**: 
   You need to be authenticated with Azure. You can do this using the Azure CLI or by setting the environment variables for your service principal.

   ```bash
   az login  # Log in using Azure CLI
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**:
   Create a directory for your Terraform configuration, and save the above code in a file named `main.tf`. Then run:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Plan the Infrastructure**:
   Generate an execution plan to see what Terraform will do:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the Configuration**:
   Create the resources defined in your configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Confirm Changes**:
   When prompted, type `yes` to proceed with the creation of resources.

### Notes
- Ensure that the name of the storage account is unique in Azure. If `myuniquestorageacct` is already taken, you will need to change it to something else.
- Adjust the `account_tier` and `account_replication_type` as needed based on your application's requirements.
- Add any
