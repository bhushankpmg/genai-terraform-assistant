To create an Azure Storage Account in a specified resource group using Terraform, you'll need to define the necessary resources in a `.tf` file. Below is a sample Terraform configuration for creating a storage account named `myuniquestorageacct` in the resource group `myresourcegroup` located in the `West Europe` region.

```hcl
# Configure the Azure provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Create a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "myresourcegroup" {
  name     = "myresourcegroup"
  location = "West Europe"
}

# Create a storage account
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "myuniquestorageacct" {
  name                     = "myuniquestorageacct"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.myresourcegroup.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.myresourcegroup.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"  # Locally Redundant Storage

  # Optional settings
  # min_tls_version = "TLS1_2"
}

# Output the storage account name
output "storage_account_name" {
  value = azurerm_storage_account.myuniquestorageacct.name
}
```

### Explanation of the configuration:
- **Provider Block**: Specifies the `azurerm` provider which is used to interact with Azure resources.
- **Resource Group**: Creates a resource group named `myresourcegroup` in `West Europe`.
- **Storage Account**:
  - `name`: Must be unique across Azure and is subject to Azure naming conventions (lowercase letters and numbers, 3-24 characters).
  - `resource_group_name`: References the resource group created earlier.
  - `location`: The same location as the resource group.
  - `account_tier`: Sets the performance tier of the storage account to `Standard`.
  - `account_replication_type`: Specifies the replication strategy (LRS - Locally Redundant Storage).
- **Output**: Outputs the storage account name after creation.

### How to use this configuration:
1. Install Terraform on your machine if you haven't already.
2. Save the above configuration in a file named `main.tf`.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.tf`.
4. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
5. Create a plan to review the resources that will be created
