To create an Azure Storage Account using Terraform, you need to define a configuration file that specifies the provider, resource group, and storage account. Below is a sample Terraform configuration that creates a storage account named 'myuniquestorageacct' in the resource group 'myresourcegroup', located in the 'West Europe' region.

Make sure to replace 'myuniquestorageacct' with a unique name, as Azure requires storage account names to be globally unique.

```hcl
# main.tf
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "myresourcegroup"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "myuniquestorageacct" # Storage account name must be in lowercase and globally unique
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"

  # Optional settings
  min_tls_version = "TLS1_2"
  is_hns_enabled  = false
}
```

### Steps to Deploy the Configuration:

1. **Install Terraform**: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine.

2. **Authenticate with Azure**: Make sure you are authenticated with Azure. You can do this using the Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. **Create a Directory for Your Configuration**: Create a new directory and navigate into it.

4. **Create the Configuration File**: Create a file named `main.tf` and copy the above configuration into it.

5. **Initialize Terraform**: Run the following command to initialize your Terraform working directory:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

6. **Plan the Deployment**: This command will show you what resources will be created without actually creating them:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

7. **Apply the Configuration**: Run the following command to create the resources:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   You'll be prompted to confirm the action. Type `yes` to proceed.

After these steps, Terraform will provision the resource group and storage account in Azure as specified in the configuration.
