To create an Azure Storage Account using Terraform, you'll need to define a Terraform configuration file that specifies the resource group, storage account, and any necessary properties. Below is an example of a Terraform configuration that meets your requirements:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "myresourcegroup"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "myuniquestorageacct" # The name must be globally unique
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier            = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS" # Locally Redundant Storage

  # Optional: Enable HTTPS traffic only
  min_tls_version = "TLS1_2"

  tags = {
    environment = "testing"
  }
}
```

### Steps to Use the Configuration:

1. **Install Terraform:** Ensure that Terraform is installed on your local machine. You can download it from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

2. **Create a Directory:** Create a new directory to hold your Terraform configuration file.

   ```bash
   mkdir azure-storage-account
   cd azure-storage-account
   ```

3. **Create a Configuration File:** Create a file named `main.tf` and copy the above Terraform configuration into this file.

4. **Initialize Terraform:** Run the following command in your terminal to initialize Terraform. This will download the required provider plugins:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

5. **Plan the Deployment:** To see what resources will be created, run:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

6. **Apply the Configuration:** To create the resources specified in your configuration, run:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the action when prompted.

7. **Check the Azure Portal:** After the process completes, you can check the Azure Portal to see the created storage account under the specified resource group.

### Note:
- The name of the storage account must be globally unique across Azure. Ensure that `myuniquestorageacct` is not already in use. You can modify the name with a unique suffix if necessary.
- This configuration uses standard locally redundant storage (LRS) and enables
